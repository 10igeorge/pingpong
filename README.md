## Description
This is a 'pingpong' test so that I may adequately apply my skills learned in week 3 of Epicodus. This includes everything covered in the first two weeks (HTML, CSS, jQuery) and BDD and JavaScript. Additionally styled with Bootstrap.

The website will allow the user to enter a number and receive an unordered list counting up to their number while at the same time replacing numbers divisible by 3 with 'ping,' numbers divisible by 5 with 'pong,' and numbers divisible by 3 AND 5 with 'pingpong.'

Enjoy!
